  <h2>What This Ebook Is About</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>3D Print Life Hacks</strong> is a hands-on, practical guide to using a home 3D printer
    as a real-world problem-solving tool. Instead of focusing on decorative prints or test objects,
    this book shows how functional 3D printing can be used to repair, improve, and customize everyday
    items—saving money, reducing waste, and extending product lifetimes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ebook focuses on small but powerful printable solutions: replacement parts, brackets, mounts,
    adapters, organizers, and enclosures that solve everyday problems in homes, workshops, gardens,
    and electronics projects.

<section id="philosophy">
  <h2>More Than 3D Printing: A Repair Mindset</h2>
  <p>
    This book promotes a shift away from throwaway culture. A broken tab, worn coupling, or missing
    bracket does not need to end a product’s life. With basic design skills and a consumer-grade 3D
    printer, users can create precise, purpose-built solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3D Print Life Hacks</strong> frames 3D printing as a sustainability tool—enabling local
    repair, creative problem-solving, and independence from mass replacement.
